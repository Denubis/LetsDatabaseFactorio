/*
From robot army wiki:

The concept is simple - manufacture droid soldiers, and insert them into a Droid Assembler where they are produced (spawned nearby). The newly created soldier will join a nearby squad if one exists, or it will start its own squad and wait until more robots join.
                                                      
When the squad is large enough (currently 5 by default, change it in config.lua) the squad will begin moving to attack the nearest biter nest (within 2.5k tiles) or other enemy force's units/buildings.

Droids are deployed by building a Droid Assembling Machine (Droid Assembler ) and inserting the Droid (Undeployed) item into it, for whatever type of droid you wanted to deploy. The mod script will scan each Droid Assembler's output inventory for a "Deployed" version of a droid and will cause the appropriate droid to spawn nearby the Droid Assembler, in the direction that it is facing (see pipe arrows). You can also deploy droids simply by having the items in your hand and clicking to place like any other object/item. This means you can keep a pocket-army with you for tight situations.

In addition to automatically deploying droids from Droid Assemblers to attack nearby biters, you can build Droid Guard Stations and put droid items in for deployment, the same as with the Droid Assemblers. The guard stations allow you to have a group of droids (10, currently) defend their nearby area (they will not go hunting). The guard station will not spawn any more droids if it counts more than 10 within 16 tile radius. 

To help clean up your battlefield or find random lost squads, you can build and place a rally point to trigger all squads on your force (EXCEPT guard squads!) to move-to the position of the rally point. 

Basically you can set up chains of a special power pole type object using green wires to join them, and guard station squads can be made to patrol along the length of the patrol route. Keep in mind this is WIP, and there might be pathfinding issues and traffic jams in some cases. Try to spread out the patrol route and have a fairly long gap between posts.
